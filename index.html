            <h1>Pikamoon™ | Official Site</h1>
            <h2>What is Pikamoon?</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://pikamoonn.github.io/"> Pikamoon </a>is a
              GameFi token that powers the Pikaverse, a metaverse comprised of
              four lands where players capture Pikamoons to Battle monsters and
              go up against the dark gods ruling and destroying these lands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your goal in the game is to travel across four lands of Pikaverse
              and defeat their respective rulers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game and the characters have taken direct inspiration from
              Pokemon, and each “Pikamoon” is reminiscent of a pocket monster.
              And like Pokemon, Pikamoon will also feature turn-based combat.
            </p>
            <p>
              With each turn, you will be given a chance to attack or heal. And
              each win will give your Pikamoon experience points. You can use
              these points to upgrade your Pikamoon or buy in-game assets from
              the Pikamoon marketplace.
            </p>
            <h2>Marketplace</h2>
            <p>
              Join millions of Pikamooners to buy, sell and trade various
              categories of assets in the in-game marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>Fortify your avatar by getting weapons, spells, and health.</p>
            <p>
              Most importantly, get some precious land to start building your
              massive empire.
            </p>

            <h2>Pikamoon Price Prediction 2024</h2>

            <p>
              Play to earn cryptos have been hit-and-miss over the past year.
              2022’s bear market, as well as other detrimental factors – like
              less focus on gameplay and more on earning mechanics – have
              started to give P2E games a bad rep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pikamoon is one of the few novel projects aiming to fix this issue
              with its “photo-realistic” take on the metaverse. The official
              whitepaper makes the planned metaverse look colorful.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A robust roadmap</li>
              <li>Good looking gameplay</li>
              <li>GameFi and DeFi mechanics are currently growing</li>
              <li>Verified and Audited Project</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pikamoon Price Prediction 2025</h2>
            <p>
              In 2025 Pikamoon will move ahead with its roadmap. And the closer
              it is to realizing its original game, the closer it will get to
              competing with the likes of Axie Infinity. However, we believe
              that going against a well-established project like Axie Infinity
              may be difficult for it as that would require a parabolic
              increase.
            </p>
            <p>
              And since Pikamoon doesn’t have the same virality of meme coins as
              of now, a more conservative PIKA price prediction could be $0.0005
              by the end of 2025.
            </p>

            <h2>Pikamoon Price Prediction 2030</h2>
            <p>
              2030 will bring more order to the volatile crypto space –
              hopefully. That will assert more utility-based tokens to rise –
              Pikamoon included. Another factor that may come into play in
              pushing PIKA’s growth would be the gameplay. If PIKA’s gameplay
              turns out to be more addicting than Axie Infinity, it could have
              high growth potential.
            </p>

            <strong>Add pikamoon Era Alpha Mainnet on MetaMask</strong>

            <p>
              You will need to connect pikamoon Era alpha mainnet to your
              MetaMask. To do this, go to your MetaMask and click on the network
              button, then “Add network”. Then, click “Add a network manually”.
              Add the following information and click “Save”:
            </p>

            <p>
              However, flipping Axie Infinity would still be difficult as that
              would require a parabolic increase of 120,000% from PIKA’s 2025
              highs. The price explosion of AXS token in the last crypto bull
              run may have been a one-off for play to earn tokens – although
              meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) have had similar success in 2023.
